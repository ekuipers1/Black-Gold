        description: "Green coffee beans are planted to grow new trees, It takes between 3 to 5 years before the tree begins to produce coffee berries, also known as cherries because of their shape and red color."

        stage: "2",
        title: "Harvesting & Picking",
        description: "While there is a general time that the berries ripen, they tend to do it in stages which means that you can’t pick the whole lot at once. This means that you’ve got to go out and pick the ripe berries, come back 8 to 10 days later to pick the next ones, and then come back another 8 to 10 days later to get the stragglers.  and then come back another 8 to 10."

        title: "Sorting & Selecting",
        description: "To ensure that only the best beans pass onto the next step the coffee cherries are first sorted. There are a few ways to do this. The simplest sorting that happens is by hand but winnowing the beans or using a large sieve to remove debris, stones, and twigs is also used."

        stage: "4",
        title: "Pulping",
        description: "Within 24 hours of the cherries being picked, they are put through a depulping machine that removes the skin and most of the pulp. This pulp and skin is usually discarded to be used as compost but some “zero waste” coffee producers use these byproducts to make things like tea from the skins."

        title: "Fermenting",
        description: "The fermentation process is where the microbial reaction of bacteria and yeasts break down the sugars in the mucilage to produce acids. 1. Low Fermentation (Wet Processing) 2. Medium Fermentation (Semi-washed) 3. High Fermentation (Dry process)"

        stage: "6",
        title: "Drying",
        description: "Regardless of the fermentation process used, the beans need to be dried until they reach a moisture content of around 11%. In the case of wet processing, the fermentation has already taken place and now it’s just a matter of drying the beans."

        title: "Grading / Cupping",
        description: "Before sending the whole batch off for roasting the coffee needs to be graded. Some fortunate people actually get paid to taste coffee and call it work.After staring sagely at the beans for a while they make an initial judgment of the quality of the coffee based on the appearance of the beans. Then it’s on to the tasting, or cupping."

        title: "Roasting",
        description: "This isn’t just a matter of flipping a switch and waiting for the timer to go off once it’s done. Roasting coffee is part science and part art. Inside those raw coffee beans is the potential to make a great cup of coffee."

        stage: "12",
        title: "Packaging",
        description: "To protect the beans from air and moisture the packaging is sealed really well so that even if it’s on the shelf for a few weeks the beans will still be fresh once the seal is broken."

        stage: "13",
        title: "Grinding",
        description: "For more consistent and finer grinds the beans need to be ground in a burr grinder. The sound of the burr grinder is far easier on the ears if you’ve just woken up and the consistent grind allows for more efficient extraction when brewing."
