    headline: "1. Brazil",
    image: "Brazil",
    content: "44,200,000 60KG Bags, Coffee first found its way to Brazil from French Guiana back in the 18th century, and it found a place to thrive! Brazil produces about 1/3 of all of the world’s coffee. Some people do feel that the quantity ends up sacrificing a bit of quality, but that’s not to say there aren’t any exquisite varieties of coffee from Brazil. Interestingly enough, Brazilian coffee is sometimes subject to frost, which devastates the crop. Frosts in Brazil inadvertently give a boost to other coffee producing countries."
